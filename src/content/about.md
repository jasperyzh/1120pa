# 👋 Hello & Welcome to 1120 Park Avenue
(About this site)

### A digital handbook by residents, for residents.

This website is a collection of information gathered over the years living at **1120 Park Avenue**. Much of this info was originally buried in WhatsApp chatgroups or posted on physical notice boards. We decided to gather it all in one place to make daily life a little easier for everyone.

### 📢 The "Neighborly" Disclaimer
**This is an unofficial project.**
We are **not** the Management Office (MO), the Joint Management Body (JMB), or the Management Corporation (MC).

While we try our best to keep things accurate, rules and fees can change. **For critical matters—like paying maintenance fees, official complaints, or checking legal notices—please always refer to the official management office or their designated app.**

### 🛠 What is this place?
Think of this as an "Un-Official Quick Start Guide" to the building.

1.  **The Info Hub:** Useful contacts, renovation hours, trash disposal info, and frequently asked questions.
2.  **Events & Announcements:** Highlights of things happening around our blocks.
3.  **Feedback:** A way for you to tell us what info is missing!


<!-- 3.  **Marketplace (Coming Soon..?):** A future space for residents to trade and sell items within the community. -->
